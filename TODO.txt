DONE: Global variables header file
DONE: Move radian functions to one file and have only one declaration
Remake averager into template (so the length of the buffer can be defined for each individual object separately)
Add timing to change destination coordinates based on time passed (put buoy in water, buoy swims to destination ant after 15min returns)
Add pin definitions file (maybe?)

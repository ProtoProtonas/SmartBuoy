DONE: Global variables header file
DONE: Move radian functions to one file and have only one declaration
DONE: Remake averager into template (so the length of the buffer can be defined for each individual object separately)
DONE: Add timing to change destination coordinates based on time passed (i.e. put buoy in water, buoy swims to destination ant after 15min returns)
DONE: Add pin definitions file (maybe?)
DONE: Add averaging for compass, stop using instantaneous value
